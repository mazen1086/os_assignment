bankers algorithm
i made the project in c# as a windows forms application
i divided the logic of the code into 5 classes : an information class that gets the values from the gui in a static lists , a resource class , a resource_process 
class that has a resource object and the max ,need and used of that resource in a specific process , a process class that contains a linked list of the resource_process
objects and an algorithm class that contains various functions for implementing the algorithm .
the windows that the program displays consists of : the first window asks the user to input the number of resources and processes in textboxes , the second window
takes the total number of the specific resource in the system and the used number of this resource , the third display a 2 gridviews that takes the data of every resource in every process
the fourth window asks the user to enter the process that request a new resource and the resource that is requested and the number of this resource and then the program give a message if the request is accepted or not
